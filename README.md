## the hell is this?
basically I got a smart led bulb and have been playing around with the different automations you can do using Alexa, IFTTT and HomeKit etc, and now want to try and actually fufill a project I have been wanting to do for years, making my curtains (and maybe blinds too) automatic.

***prepare youself for the worst in mechanical design, electrical & software engineering and forethought***

## Questions
1.  how do you spell curtain
2.  What type of string to use?
3.  How to mount it to the rail
4.  Microcontroller onboard? or central hub?
5.  How am I going to power it
6.  How am I going to integreate it with Alexa, HA, HomeKit etc? Probably will use a NodeMCU so check out what's out there in terms of arduino projects / libs

## Progress notes
- 01:32 2/7/21 Basic concept done, need to research strings + their diameters and position limit sw and guide accordingly. Also need to make / design / find a way to mount this thing to the rail.
