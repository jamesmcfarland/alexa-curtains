## Questions
1.  how
2.  What type of string to use?
3.  How to mount it to the rail
4.  Microcontroller onboard? or central hub?
5.  How am I going to power it
6.  How am I going to integreate it with Alexa, HA, HomeKit etc? Probably will use a NodeMCU so check out what's out there in terms of arduino projects / libs

## Progress notes
- 01:32 2/7/21 Basic concept done, need to research strings + their diameters and position limit sw and guide accordingly. Also need to make / design / find a way to mount this thing to the rail.
